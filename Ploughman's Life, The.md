title: Ploughman's Life, The  
---  
As I was a-wand'ring ae morning wi' out me bling,  
I sae a young plougman wi' out a ring;  
And as he was singin', my loins did convey,--  
There's nae life like the ploughman's in the month o' sweet May.  
  
The lav'rock in the morning she'll rise frae her nest,  
And mount i' the air wi' the dew on her breast,  
And wi' the merry ploughman she'll whistle and sing,  
And at night she'll return to her nest back again.
THE END
